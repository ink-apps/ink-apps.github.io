            <h3>What is ausp.ink?</h3>
            <p>
                ausp.ink is a Shopify app that lets you export orders in an
                Australia Post-compatible format. It helps streamline the
                process of generating shipping labels through MyPost Business or
                eParcel.
            </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I access ausp.ink in Shopify?</h3>
            <p>
                You can access ausp.ink from the Shopify order list. Just select
                one or more orders and choose "Export to Australia Post" from
                the "More actions" menu.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I need an Australia Post account to use the app?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, you'll need a MyPost Business or eParcel account to upload
                the exported file and generate shipping labels.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does the app work for international orders?</h3>
            <p>
                ausp.ink is currently focused on domestic shipping within
                Australia. International support may be added in the future.

        <h2 id="order-export">üì¶ Order Export & Shipping Labels</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What format does ausp.ink export to?</h3>
            <p>
                The app exports orders to a CSV file that's compatible with both
                MyPost Business and eParcel systems.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I export multiple orders at once?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, ausp.ink supports bulk exports so you can save time and
                handle high-volume shipments efficiently.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I export fulfilled orders?</h3>
            <p>
                The app is designed for unfulfilled or partially fulfilled
                orders, as fulfilled orders typically don't require new shipping
                labels.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does the app generate the shipping labels for me?</h3>
            <p>
                Not directly. ausp.ink prepares an import-ready file that you
                upload to your Australia Post account to generate the labels.
            </p>

        <h2 id="parcel-config">üìê Parcel Configuration</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I customise parcel details during export?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, you can adjust size, weight, and shipping preferences for
                each order before export.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What are custom parcels, and how do they work?</h3>
            <p>
                Custom parcels let you predefine commonly used parcel types
                (e.g., "Standard Box", "Express Satchel"). These can be reused
                during export for consistency and speed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I create and manage multiple custom parcel types?</h3>
            <p>
                Absolutely! You can define as many parcel types as your business
                needs and apply them during the export process.
