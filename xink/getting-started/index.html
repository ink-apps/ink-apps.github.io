                    Find x.ink in the Shopify App Store and click install. The
                    app will request permissions to access your store data to
                    facilitate the Xero integration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once installed, you'll be taken to the x.ink dashboard where
                    you can begin setting up your Xero connection.

                <p>
                    After authorization, you'll be returned to the x.ink

                <p>
                    On the "Settings" page, you need to configure the account in
                    Xero that should be used for invoices and payments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first two dropdown are to select the sales account and
                    the freight account. The accounts listed in the dropdown are
                    pulled from Xero and represent what is currently configured
                    in your Xero account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next two dropdowns are to select the tax accounts, for
                    taxable and tax free items. Once again, the tax types listed
                    are pulled from your Xero account.

                    Below account and tax settings, you'll find the section to
                    configure how Shopify payment methods are mapped in Xero.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each payment method, select the corresponding Xero bank
                    account where the payments should be recorded, the account fees should be recorded, as well as further settings to make sure payments are properly categorized and reconciled:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Sync With Xero?</b> Whether the Shopofy transaction should be recorded as a payment in Xero</li>
                        <li><b>Mark Reconciled?</b> Whether the payment should be marked as reconciled in Xero on creation</li>
                        <li><b>Create Manual Journal?</b> Whether a manual journal should be created to account for the transaction fees</li>

                <p>
                    Depending on your store and offerings, you may need to map a
                    few payment methods. If you accept payment methods that are not
                    supported by x.ink, please <a href="mailto:inkapps.tom@gmail.com">send us a message</a>
                    so we can add them.
                </p>

                    Some helpful tips:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Zero Payment</b> Always configure a zero payment method to record transactions without payment</li>
                        <li><b>Cash</b> If you accept cash payments, consider turning on the "Mark Reconciled" option</li>
                        <li><b>Paypal</b> Depending on how you connect Paypal with Xero, you may not want to enable the "Sync With Xero" option</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    Once all settings are configured, you cango to the top of the "Settings"
                    page and enable Auto Sync.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From then on, all orders and transactions that occur in Shopify will be
                    automatically synced to Xero, according to the settings and mappings you have configured.
