            <h3>What does the app do?</h3>
            <p>
                Our app syncs your Shopify orders and transactions directly into
                Xero ‚Äî automatically and accurately. It creates Xero invoices,
                applies payments, handles refunds, discounts, and covers all
                common payment types.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Who is this app for?</h3>
            <p>
                It's built for Australian Shopify store owners who want to keep
                their accounting clean, simple, and automated with Xero.
            </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I need to be tech-savvy to use it?</h3>
            <p>
                Not at all! Setup takes just a few minutes, and we
                <a href="/xink/getting-started">guide you through every step</a

        <h2 id="syncing">üîÅ Syncing</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How often does the app sync?</h3>
            <p>
                The app syncs in near real-time. Your Shopify orders and
                transactions show up in Xero shortly after they're processed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I sync past (historical) orders?</h3>
            <p>
                At the moment, we only sync new orders from the time you install
                the app onwards. Syncing historical orders is a feature we're
                working on.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I choose what gets synced?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes. You can configure which transaction types are synced based
                on the payment method.
            </p>

        <h2 id="payments">üí≥ Payments, Refunds & Discounts</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What payment types are supported?</h3>
            <p>
                We support all major gateways ‚Äî Shopify Payments, PayPal,
                Stripe, Afterpay, and more. You can map each to specific Xero
                accounts.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How are refunds handled?</h3>
            <p>
                Refunds processed in Shopify are automatically reflected in Xero
                as invoice adjustments.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do discounts sync correctly?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes. Whether it's a discount on an item or the entire order,
                it's all accounted for in Xero.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I map sales to different Xero accounts?</h3>
            <p>
                Definitely. You can map sales, taxes, shipping, and payments to
                your preferred Xero accounts.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does it support GST and Australian tax settings?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes ‚Äî we're built with Australian tax compliance in mind. GST is
                synced properly whether your prices are tax-inclusive or
                exclusive.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do you support multi-currency?</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, we support AUD as the primary currency. Other
                currencies are handled through Shopify and can be converted to
                AUD before syncing to Xero.

        <div class="faq-item">
